## 🧠 Age and Gender Detection using Deep Learning

This project predicts a person’s **age group** and **gender** from an image using a deep learning model integrated with a Flask web app. It combines computer vision and CNN-based feature extraction to deliver accurate results in real time. The clean interface built with HTML templates makes interaction smooth and intuitive, while the backend handles all image processing and model inference seamlessly.
